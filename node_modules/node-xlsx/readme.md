=================

Excel parser/builder that relies on [xlsx.js](https://raw.github.com/stephen-hardy/xlsx.js) (Microsoft Office Extensible File License).

Quick start
-----------

Parsing a xlsx from file/buffer
``` javascript
var xlsx = require('node-xlsx');

var obj = xlsx.parse(__dirname + '/myFile.xlsx'); // parses a file

var obj = xlsx.parse(fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/myFile.xlsx')); // parses a buffer

```

Building a plist from an object
``` javascript
var xlsx = require('node-xlsx');

var buffer = xlsx.build({worksheets: [
  {"name":"mySheetName", "data":[
    ["A1", "B1"],
    [
      {"value":"A2","formatCode":"General"},
      {"value":"B2","formatCode":"General"}
    ]
  ]}
]}); // returns a buffer

```
